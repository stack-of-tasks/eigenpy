- full support of np.array which becomes the default conversion format. The end-user is still able to switch to numpy.matrix by calling eigenpy.switchToNumpyMatrix()
- we provide a full exposition of the Eigen decompositions (LLT, LDLT, EigenSolvers, etc.)
- fixes have been done that were appearing in some very particular cases

## [1.6.13] - 2020-01-10

This new release uniformizes the build of unitary tests and also provides a new function to set the random seed of the std random generator.

## [1.6.7] - 2019-11-15

This new release fixes some compilations of EigenPy on the ROS build farm.
Thanks to [@wxmerkt](https://github.com/wxmerkt] for the fix.

## [1.6.6] - 2019-11-13

This new patched release improves the packaging of the project with respect to external forges.

## [1.6.5] - 2019-11-08

This new release fixes the export of the Eigen project for CMake targets relying on EigenPy.
It also provides some fixes aroung Geometry classes.

## [1.6.4] - 2019-11-07

This new release improves the packaging of the project with respect to ROS and also fixes some constructors issues with respect to the Quaternion class.

## [1.6.3] - 2019-10-29

This release fix issues introduced recently in the packaging which was preventing the project to correctly export the main library.

## [1.6.2] - 2019-10-24

This is a maintenance release that improves the packaging for Windows and ROS. It also fixes some bugs in the bindings of Quaternion.

## [1.6.1] - 2019-10-16

This new release provides default exposition of Eigen vector and matrix which are common. On the packaging side, the project is now fully compatible with the new CMake rules for defining and calling the `PROJECT` master function.

## [1.6.0] - 2019-09-19

This new release makes a step towards removing the conversion of `Eigen::Matrix` objects into `numpy.matrix` objects. This new release now warms by default, saying that you need to make an explicit choice between `numpy.matrix` and `numpy.array`.

Future major releases will enforce the default case with `numpy.array`.

## [1.5.8] - 2019-09-09

This new release mostly removes a useless print when loading a converter.

## [1.5.7] - 2019-07-19

This new release adds the support of Windows OS (thanks to [@seanyen](https://github.com/seanyen]).
It also provides some fixes with respect to recent versions of Boost.Python (>= 1.70.0).

## [1.5.6] - 2019-07-16

This release fixes some compatibility issues with anaconda.

## [1.5.5] - 2019-07-15

This new release improves the packaging with respect to Boost >= 1.70.0.
This is needed for complete integration inside Anaconda.

## [1.5.4] - 2019-07-13

This new release mostly improves the packaging of the project, also with ROS.

## [1.5.3] - 2019-06-28

This new release fixes a serious bug with duplicates symbols.

## [1.5.2] - 2019-06-26

This new release fixes two important bugs:
- a type already registered by another library will have a symbolic link in the current scope
- when using the array convention, the Eigen vector objects become flatten numpy.array

## [1.5.1] - 2019-04-16

This new release fixes a serious bug related to Python3 which was occurring when exiting the interpreter.
This new release makes also official the new BSD license.

## [1.5.0] - 2018-10-29

This new release allows now to support the conversion from C++ to Python either as numpy.matrix or as numpy.array.

The use can switch between both features by calling in Python
```
eigenpy.switchToNumpyArray()
```
to convert Eigen::Matrix to numpy.array. Or
```
eigenpy.switchToNumpyMatrix()
```
to select conversion from Eigen::Matrix to numpy.matrix.

Thanks to [@jviereck](https://github.com/jviereck] for raising the lost of performances induced by numpy.matrix.

## [1.4.5] - 2018-08-29

Fix compatibility with Eigen 3.3.5

## [1.4.4] - 2018-07-19

This is a minor release.
It allows to register Eigen::MatrixBase\<MatType\> from Python to Eigen converters.

## [1.4.3] - 2018-05-12

This release fixes several compatibility issues at the Cmake level for both Python 3 and recent versions of Boost >= 1.67.0.

## [1.4.2] - 2018-05-02

This new release allows the binding of Eigen::Ref, facilitates the conversion between compatible scalars (eigenpy won't warn if the numpy matrix has integer scalar type).
This new release also improves the compatibility with Python 3.x.

## [1.4.1] - 2018-02-26

This is mostly a maintenance release where some fixes have been done with respect to BSD systems.
We also fixed an issue concerning the catching of exceptions: they are now verbose.

## [1.4.0] - 2018-01-14

This new release introduces an independent eigenpy library that exposes Eigen solvers in Python.
It also allows to use directly NumPy memory through famous Eigen::Ref that are just memory mapping.

## [1.3.3] - 2017-06-09

It is mostly a maintenance release with suppression of warnings and use of correct types.

## [1.3.2] - 2016-11-21

### Summary

This new release allows the check of registration of any class. This allows to not define twice the same symbols. Thanks to the macro defined in memory.hpp, one can now relies on aligned vector and matrices. The unaligned equivalent type is no more required.
This release also improves the exposed API of Quaternions and AngleAxis Eigen classes. The install of documentation can be avoided by setting cmake option INSTALL_DOCUMENTATION to OFF.

### Bug Fix
- the Python function _import_array() must be called first before any class to PyArray functions.

## [1.3.1] - 2016-09-23

### Summary

This new release fixes several bugs encounter in the linkage of EigenPy with other libs integrating Python interpreter. It also improve the packaging of the module by removing the dependencies to the Python lib and making Boost Python defined with undefined symbols (useful for OS X - the library is no more static on OS X).

### Bug Fix
- UnalignedEquivalent struct take now an optional Scalar template
- PyMatrixType is now a singleton, avoiding bad initialisation during dynamic loading of shared lib.

## [1.3.0] - 2016-02-03

### Summary

Alignment of Eigen and Numpy objects is now properly handled.
One can now easily expose C++ struct containing Eigen objects in Python avoiding any unnecessary conversion and data are aligned in memory.

### Bug Fix
- Fix issue in the creation of row and column vectors.
- The library has to be static under OS X to properly expose symbols.
